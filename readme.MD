# Turkish Financial Sentiment Lexicon - Translation

This repository contains a translation of Loughran and McDonald's [1] financial
sentiment lexicon. For each term in the original lexicon, we provide a Turkish
translation.

The original English terms are given in the second column of the `tr_loughran_vocab.csv` file,
while the closest Turkish matches are in the first column.

In cases of lexical ambiguity, the closest matching Turkish term used in financial or legal contexts
was used. When an English term had more than one such translation, both were included.

Seeing as Turkish is an agglutinative language, only word stems were included in the vocabulary.
